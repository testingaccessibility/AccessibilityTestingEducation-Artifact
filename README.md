## Purpose
This artifact contains the lectures, assignments, interview questions, code to calculate agreement rate, and the data for the paper title ***"Beyond the Checklist: Teaching Software Accessibility from a Testing Perspective"***

The 'lectures' directory contains the lectures given throughout the course series (***Note***: The lectures will be added after the reviewing process to remain anonymous).

The 'assignments' directory contains the four assignments given to the students.

The 'questions' directory contains both the guide questions for the open class discussion and the questions used during the individual interviews.

The 'agreement-code' directory contains the code used to calculate the agreement rate between the authors.

The 'label-and-data' directory contains the preliminary labels and the final labels with the data that was analyzed.

## Detailed Description

#### Lectures
The 'lectures' directory contains a total of six lectures. Additionally, it also includes the paper presentations given by the instructor and the presentation of the tool demo given to the students.

#### Assignments
The 'assignments' directory contains the four assignments given to the students. Assignment 1 and Assignment 4 measured student's knowledge on the topic of Software Accessibility. Assignment 2 and Assignment 3 asked students to conduct manual and automated testing, respectively.

#### Questions
The 'questions' directory contains the six questions that were employed as a guide during the open class discussion. Additionally, it also includes, the questions that were asked during individual interviews, which are divided into three categories: pedagogical approach, software accessibility testing and demographic information.

#### Agreement-Code
The 'agreement-code' directory contains the code used to calculate the agreement rate between the three authors in charge of labeling the data. The code was retrieved from: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68364284/.

#### Label and Data
The 'label-and-data' directory contains two draft templates, one for each pair of assignments, with the initial labels the authors came up during the preliminary phases of the data analysis. It also includes, the final labels and the data analyzed in the study.
